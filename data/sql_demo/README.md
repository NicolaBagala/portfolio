# SQL Demo

_**Tech used:** JupyterLab, SQLite, Python, Pandas_

<p align="justify">This is a fairly short project whose goal is simply to give the reader an idea of my SQL skills. Rather than a fully-fledged analysis, it contains different, separate queries that you might find in a real-life application.  It features complex <b>data manipulation</b>, <b>database creation</b>, <b>views</b>, a little bit of <b>window functions</b>, and <b>interaction with Python.</b> There isn't much else to say other than have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/NicolaBagala/portfolio/blob/master/sql_demo/sql_demo.ipynb">project's notebook</a>!</p>
