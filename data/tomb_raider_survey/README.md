<p align="justify">The <i>Tomb Raider</i> franchise, which revolves around the adventures of archaeologist Lara Croft, has seen a number of reboots and revamps of its main character over the years. Sometimes, the differences are smallâ€”like those between the Classic and LAU series; in other cases, the differences are quite big, like in the case of the Classic and <i>Survivor</i> series. As a fan myself, I was interested in understanding the preferences of the fanbase not only for different series, but also for the three different versions of Lara. More precisely, I wanted to find an answer to three main questions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Many think that Lara's exaggerated sex appeal in Classic and LAU games made both the games and the character unlikeable to female players. <strong>Is it true? Do they prefer Survivor Lara and/or <i>Survivor</i> games?</strong></li>
  <li>Another common assumption is that Classic/LAU Lara looked the way they did to please straight male players. If that's true, <strong>do straight males prefer Classic/LAU Lara over the much more average-looking Survivor Lara?</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Does the fandom agree that Classic/LAU Lara was oversexualised?</strong></li>
</ol>

<p align="justify">To figure it all out, I ran a survey and analysed the results. In this summary, I'll briefly discuss only the results concerning the three questions above; if you're interested, the full project goes into a lot more detail.</p>

<p align="justify"><strong>Female respondents definitely <i>did</i> enjoy Classic and LAU games, and they did so more than they enjoyed <i>Survivor</i> games.</strong> The chart below illustrates this both in absolute and percentage terms: when the measure of game enjoyment is positive or neutral (answers <i>A lot</i>, <i>Quite a bit</i>, and <i>Somewhat</i>), <i>Survivor</i> games are always trailing behind Classic or LAU games (or both); when the measure is negative (answers <i>A little</i> and <i>Not at all</i>), they always "beat" the other two series, so to speak.<br><br>

<p align="justify">In terms of which sex prefers which version of Lara, the sample data is unequivocal that, surprisingly, <strong>female players who prefer Classic and LAU Lara (the allegedly "oversexualised" versions of Lara!) are more than those who prefer Survivor Lara;</strong> Classic Lara is the favourite of both female and male players, but interestingly, more male players prefer Survivor Lara over LAU Lara, and in percentage, <strong>a fair bit more male players than female players prefer Survivor Lara!</strong> (The full project digs deeper into this, accounting for the sexual orientation of the respondents.)<br><br></p>

<p align="center">

</p>

<p align="justify">A statistical analysis of this result revealed that, with 95% confidence, <strong>Classic Lara is likely the favourite of both male <i>and</i> female fans in general.</strong> Unfortunately, the sample wasn't large enough to produce smaller confidence intervals; there's often significant overlap, and therefore the estimated proportions below aren't as accurate as they could be. But even so, <strong>in the case of female players, there's no overlap between the intervals of Survivor and Classic Lara,</strong> making it unlikely that Survivor Lara might be the ladies' favourite. <strong>For male players, instead, the overlap makes it quite possible that Survivor Lara might be the winner.</strong> Only a survey with more respondents may answer this question, but in any case, these results fly right in the face of commonly held assumptions about Lara Croft and her fanbase's preferences.<br><br></p>

</p>

<p align="justify">The final question, i.e. whether Classic/LAU Lara (CLL for short) was oversexualised, is pretty much settled according to the respondents: <strong>No, she was not,</strong> said a staggering 49.5% of the respondents. (If you browse the full project, you'll see that males and females picked every option in nearly identical percentages.)<br><br></p>

<p align="center">

</p>

<p align="justify">However, inference on these results revealed that it's still possible that, at the fandom level, the answer might instead be "Yes", as shown by the overlap of the confidence intervals below.<br><br></p>
