    "This analysis is a \"remake\" of a project I made for fun and shared on my blog and my YouTube channel. It focusses on [Lara Croft](https://en.wikipedia.com/wiki/Lara_Croft), the fictional British archaeologist-adventurer starring as the main character of the [_Tomb Raider_](https://en.wikipedia.com/wiki/Tomb_Raider) videogame franchise. (This is the codefree version of the project; if you're interested in the code, click [here](https://github.com/NicolaBagala/portfolio/blob/master/data/tomb_raider_survey/tr_survey.ipynb).)\n",
    "\n",
    "Lara Croft has notoriously been a controversial character ever since her debut in 1996. While her fans regard her as an empowered heroine in the male-dominated videogame landscape, detractors see her as just another oversexualised female character created merely to please male players, and whose intentionally exaggerated sex appeal was exploited as a promotional and marketing gimmick from the very start.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above is especially true of the very first [_Tomb Raider_ series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomb_Raider#History) (known as the Classic series) and the LAU trilogy, the franchise's first reboot. (LAU stands for _Legend_, _Anniversary_, and _Underworld_, the three installments in the series.) Differences between these two series are relatively minimal in every respect, but the same can't be said of the _Survivor_ trilogy. This was a hard reboot that dramatically changed the gameplay, the backstory, and Lara's character inside out; she was given a more average-looking body and face, as well as a rather different personality, all of which should supposedly have made her a more relatable character for modern audiences and especially female players. However, the stark constrast between _Survivor_ games and preceeding ones has polarised the fandom somewhat: while some players seem to enjoy all _Tomb Raider_ series, many others appear to prefer strongly either Classic and/or LAU games or _Survivor_ games, and the same can be said of the different versions of Lara starring in each series.\n",
    "\n",
    "After spending some time interacting with the _Tomb Raider_ fanbase and reading articles about the franchise history, I was left with questions to answer and doubts to resolve:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Is it true that Lara's exaggerated sex appeal in Classic and LAU games made both the games and the character unlikeable to female players?** Do they prefer Survivor Lara and/or _Survivor_ games instead?\n",
    "2. Classic and LAU Lara's sex appeal was supposedly intended to attract straight male players. **Do straight males actually prefer Classic/LAU Lara over Survivor Lara?**\n",
    "3. **Does the fandom agree that Classic/LAU Lara was oversexualised? In what ways?** What percentage of the fandom agrees? What factors, if any, influenced their opinion?\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer these questions, I prepared a [survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfo33HsdO5OEmI620z8POBSucdDoZphy8X_JqxjGxZoS6I7eg/viewform) in Google Forms and shared it on _Tomb Raider_-related subreddits, Facebook groups, Twitter accounts, Discord servers, and forums, in the summer of 2021; only respondents who played at least one _Tomb Raider_ game were allowed to complete the survey. The scope of my original project was actually larger than just answering the three questions above, but here I'm going to deal only with these questions plus a few extra ones to better understand the _Tomb Raider_ fanbase. Due to limited sample size, this will be mostly an exploratory analysis of the survey results, but I will also make use of statistical inference to try to generalise some conclusions to the fanbase as a whole."

In few cases when the subsample size was at least within the assumptions of the central limit theorem, I constructed confidence intervals for the observed point estimates, but they're all to be taken with several grains of salt because of the fairly large margin of error.

    "[Historically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_and_video_games), most gamers were male, especially during the earlier years of the _Tomb Raider_ franchise. This might be a reason explaining the lower percentage of female _Tomb Raider_ fans, despite the fact that the overall percentage of female gamers is presently inching towards 50%. However, this statistic is most likely affected by the userbase of the platforms where I shared my survey; for example, Reddit is [mostly male](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1255182/distribution-of-users-on-reddit-worldwide-gender/), and so is [Twitter](https://www.statista.com/statistics/828092/distribution-of-users-on-twitter-worldwide-gender/). The same reasoning applies to other demographic variables: any over- or underrepresented age cohorts or sexual orientations on the social media outlets I used are likely to have skewed the results.\n",

    "**The majority of the respondents were between the ages of 25 and 34,** meaning that they were at most about 10 years old when the first _Tomb Raider_ was released and they may well have been fans ever since the franchise's early days. Keeping in mind the aforementioned caveats on the representativity of this sample, it's however interesting that only about 11% of the respondents were in the 35-44 age group; people of this cohort were teenagers when Lara Croft first appeared on the scene, and I would have expected them to constitute the majority of the fanbase. (Keep in mind that some people in the majority cohort weren't even born when the first game came out!) However, it's possible that all these younger fans were drawn to the franchise by later installments—some of which were published as late as the mid-2010's."

    "`Figure 4` leaves little doubt that, in the sample, the Classic _Tomb Raider_ series was enjoyed more than others. About 55% of the respondents liked the Classic series `A lot`—an option that, for this series, was chosen by a majority in both absolute and percentage terms. While this series was liked `Quite a bit` and `Somewhat` less than the other two, this is abundantly compensated for by the many more players who liked it `A lot` and the near absence of respondents who liked it `A little` or `Not at all.` More respondents didn't play the Classic series than the other two, possibly because it's so much older and fairly problematic to run on newer systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "LAU performed decently and systematically better than _Survivor_: it was liked `A lot`, `Quite a bit`, and `Somewhat` always at least a bit more than _Survivor_ was, and the respondents who said they liked it `A little` or `Not at all` were always quite a bit fewer than those who said the same of _Survivor_. Respondents who didn't play LAU were only slightly fewer than those who didn't play the classics, but still more than 13% of the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "The _Survivor_ series was far more played in the sample, with only barely 4% of respondents saying they didn't play it, but it registers the highest amount of negative feedback, being liked `A little` or `Not at all` far more than the other two series put together, both in absolute and relative terms. _Survivor_ certainly doesn't lack positive feedback, but it was liked `A lot`, `Quite a bit`, and `Somewhat` always less than at least either of the other two series.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, not all options were chosen a sufficient number of times to be safely considered representative of the whole fandom; this is especially true of the negative options. For this reason, any extrapolation beyond the sample would be strained at best, but we can still dig a bit deeper into the preferences of the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, being liked `A lot` is better than being liked `Quite a bit`; so, for example, being liked `A lot` by 50 respondents should be better than being liked `Quite a bit` by the same number of respondents. One could even argue that being liked `A lot` by 50 people is better than than being liked `Quite a bit` by 60 people. I decided to model this reasoning by assigning arbitrary \"enjoyment scores\" to each of the options as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Not at all`: -2\n",
    "- `A little` -1\n",
    "- `Somewhat`: 0\n",
    "- `Quite a bit`: 1\n",
    "- `A lot`: 2\n",
    "\n",
    "I left out `Didn't play` because, obviously, it doesn't make sense to ask how much a respondent enjoyed a series they didn't play; I assumed `Somewhat` to be a \"neutral\" answer chosen by respondents who liked some features of a series but disliked others in similar proportions, so `0` seemed a natural choice for its value. I then summed all negative and positive scores separately for each series, and then added them together to obtain an overall score. Each of these three scores was then divided by the maximum possible score for the series, calculated as $2 \\cdot n_s$, where $n_s$ is the number of respondents who played a certain series. The number of respondents that played each series (so, excluding any `Didn't play`) is given below."

    "- **neither `OSX-yes`, nor `OSX-no` respondents scored Classic games negatively.** The score of `OSX-no` respondents is however somewhat higher. What this might suggest is that even though `OSX-yes` respondents _did_ think that Lara was oversexualised, this didn't prevent them from enjoying the classics; they might, however, have enjoyed them _more_ had Lara been less sexualised in their opinion.\n",
    "\n",
    "- LAU doesn't have much of a negative score either, but its situation is, in a way, opposite to that of the classics: `OSX-yes` respondents scored it slightly higher than they did the classics, though the difference is minimal. `OSX-no` respondents scored it quite a bit lower, but the reason is probably unrelated to their `OSX` opinion. (Unless they didn't enjoy LAU that much because they didn't think LAU Lara was sufficiently oversexualised!)\n",
    "\n",
    "- _Survivor_ scores a bit higher than the other two series amongst `OSX-yes` respondents, but **the `OSX-no` folks are much more interesting in that they disliked _Survivor_ enough to bring its overall score to the negative side.**\n",
    "\n",
    "None of this can definitively quantify how much CLL's alleged oversexualisation the female fanbase's enjoyment of any _Tomb Raider_ series. Without asking more targeted questions, we can't rule out that the reason any respondent liked or disliked a certain series had nothing to do with their opinion on CLL's oversexualisation. However, **it seems improbable that `OSX-yes` respondents actually enjoyed the Classic series less than they might have because they thought Lara was oversexualised;** LAU Lara was every bit of a _femme fatale_ as Classic Lara (if not more), yet the same eighteen `OSX-yes` respondents rated the LAU series a bit higher than they did the classics. The fact that the score of `OSX-no` respondents is higher may well be an artefact due to the different sample sizes (both of which are rather small to begin with), and only a much larger sample could resolve this question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Speaking of _Survivor_, the relatively large negative score given to it by `OSX-no` respondents—especially compared to the tiny negative score of the `OSX-yes` camp—suggests that **not liking _Survivor_ games very much and thinking CLL was _not_ oversexualised correlate**, at least among female respondents. This is actually something that we'll see more in detail in another section; for now, we can conclude this section by having a look at how much female respondents enjoyed each series, in absolute and percentage terms, depending on their `OSX` stance."

At a sample level, this seems to suggest that hardcore Classic and _Survivor_ fans might feel more strongly about this issue than LAU fans.\n",

    "If we exclude the `OSX-unsure` people and recalculate the percentages above, we can see whether different levels of enjoyment for different series correlate with a skew towards `OSX-yes` or `OSX-no`. In the charts below, the blue lines illustrate the difference between the recalculated percentages of `OSX-yes` and `OSX-no` respondents for each enjoyment group of every series. A positive difference means a group is more skewed towards `OSX-yes` (green area), while a negative difference means it's more skewed towards `OSX-no` (red area). The closer that the blue line is to zero, the more similar to each other are the two percentages."

As I found out, while not small or necessarily common, her breast size isn't unheard of for women, unlike her waist circumference, which averages 49 centimetres across all Classic and LAU games, with an all-time lowest of merely 41 centimetres and a maximum of 56 centimetres. Very few critics ever seem to pay attention to this, but the percentage of fans who voted for the `WAIST` option is nonetheless decent. \n",

(It should be noted that what constitutes an \"unrealistic\" measurement wasn't explicitly defined and therefore likely varied for each respondent.)\n",

Also note that, in percentage, female respondents picked nearly every option more frequently than male respondents did, except `BREASTS`, `HIPS` and `WAIST`, which is somewhat surprising. About 50% of them noticed Lara's abnormally tiny waist, which is a fair percentage, but the fact that 20% more males than females did is noteworthy.

However, the straight-female subsample is not comparable in size to the straight-male one, and is in itself too small to draw any meaningful conclusions.

    "In this project, I tried to answer some questions about the perception that the _Tomb Raider_ fandom has of Classic and LAU Lara Croft, as well as to gain insights on the fandom itself. The dataset, obtained through a survey I ran on different social media outlets, contained the answers to 20 different questions of 208 total respondents.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sample in the dataset is mostly male, with younger people between the ages of 18 and 34 constituting the overwhelming majority. While nearly half of the respondents are heterosexual, other orientations exist in relatively large percentages. Overall, Classic _Tomb Raider_ games are the respondents' favourite, especially compared to _Survivor_ games which are the least liked. While age does seem to play a role in how much Classic, LAU, and _Survivor_ games are liked, _Survivor_ games are liked significantly less across all age cohorts.\n",
    "\n",
    "I set out to establish whether Lara's exaggerated sex appeal in Classic and LAU games made the games unlikeable to female players, or anyway less likeable than for males. I further wanted to see if female players prefer _Survivor_ games, for this or any other reason. My analysis revealed that **female players in the sample enjoyed Classic games more than LAU games, and LAU games more than _Survivor_ games, whose enjoyment score is over 30% lower than that of Classic games.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, sampled female players like Classic games more than males do when measured by overall enjoyment score, although by a small margin. They like both LAU and _Survivor_ games less than males, again not by much. Fewer females than males, in percentage, gave a positive enjoyment score to _Survivor_ games, and more gave a negative one. \n",
    "\n",
    "Generalising these findings to the whole fandom wasn't possible, because some some subsamples (such as the respondents who liked the Classic series only `A little`, among others) were too small to build reliable confidence intervals. However, at a sample level, **the data contradict the hypothesis that female players didn't enjoy Classic and LAU games, and that they prefer _Survivor_ games instead.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Another question I set out to answer was whether Classic and LAU Lara are less liked than Survivor Lara by female players because of their over-the-top sex appeal, and whether straight male players like them more than Survivor Lara for the same reason. The data shows that **Classic Lara is favoured by about 40% of all respondents;** the other two versions virtually tie at around 26%. Although the margin of error for these estimates is large, the analysis showed that, **at a fandom level, we can be 95% sure that Classic Lara is preferred by a larger percentage of the fanbase than the other two versions of Lara.** In the sample, these preferences appear to be influenced somewhat by age, and especially Classic Lara's popularity is higher among older respondents. That notwithstanding, **Survivor Lara is not the absolute favourite of any age cohort.**\n",
    "\n",
    "When broken down by sex, these preferences reveal that, in percentage, **more females than males in the sample prefer Classic and LAU Lara, whereas males prefer Survivor Lara in a fairly higher percentage than females do.** For both sexes, the favourite remains Classic Lara. The least favourites are LAU Lara for males and Survivor Lara for females. At a fandom level, all we could determine with 95% confidence is that **Survivor Lara is unlikely to be the favourite of female fans, with Classic Lara being most likely their favourite;** instead, any other version might be the males' favourite, including Survivor Lara. While all three versions might be liked in equal proportions by both sexes, the analysis suggests that the percentage of male fans preferring Survivor Lara is up to over 20% larger than that of her female fans. Classic and LAU Lara, instead, are more likely to be preferred by a larger proportion of female fans.\n",
    "\n",
    "About **straight males specifically, in the sample they unequivocally prefer Survivor Lara (38%)**, Classic Lara trailing nearly 13 percentage points behind and being their least favourite. Once more, age seems to play a role, with Classic Lara generally scoring higher among older cohorts and vice-versa for Survivor Lara. Preference for LAU Lara goes up and down with age, a trend that was observed many times for both her and LAU games overall, not only as a function of age.\n",
    "\n",
    "When sexual attraction is removed from the equation, preferences among straight males do change, but in an unexpected way. Among straight males who said they were _not_ attracted to Classic Lara, the percentage of those whose favourite was still Classic Lara decreased only by 6.8% compared to the baseline. (That is, the preferences expressed by all straight males in the sample.) This same decline is much more sharp for LAU Lara (24.6%) and Survivor Lara (32.4%), suggesting **preference for LAU or Survivor Lara among straight males may depend on sex appeal more than it does in the case of Classic Lara.**  \n",
    "\n",
    "95% confidence intervals don't allow to rule out any version of Lara as the one preferred by a larger proportion of male fans, but **in the case of non-straight males, Classic Lara is likely the fandom's favourite.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Out of the 208 respondents, **only short of 39% think CLL was oversexualised** (`OSX-yes` for short). Nearly 50% disagreed, and 12% were undecided. At a 95% confidence level, it is possible that the percentage of `OSX-yes` and `OSX-no` may be equal, but that chance is low.\n",
    "Males and females in the sample agree, disagree, and are undecided on this issue in very similar percentages, though the margin of error is high, and at a fandom level these percentages might differ by as much as 30% in a worst-case scenario.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that the enjoyment level of each _Tomb Raider_ series appears to affect the respondents' opinion: **higher levels of enjoyment of Classic and LAU games correlate with lower percentages of `OSX-yes`, and vice-versa for _Survivor_ games.** However, the data seems to indicate that disliking Classic games is a better predictor of a respondent being `OSX-yes` than liking _Survivor_ games is. Similarly, **the more a respondent likes Classic or LAU Lara, the less likely they are to be `OSX-yes`, anv vice-versa for Survivor Lara.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of which features were oversexualised, **males and females tended to disagree to varying extents about nearly every feature;** females appeared to be slightly more critical overall—except physical features, about which, interestingly, they were fairly less critical than males. Finally, an interesting trend in the data suggests that **straight and non-straight respondents may have different definitions of \n",
    "oversexualisation of a character,** with non-straight respondents putting far more emphasis on character presentation than straight respondents do. Accentuation of physical traits appears to matter for both parties, though arguably more for straight respondents.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Caveats\n",
    "\n",
    "When I conceived this survey, I did not plan to do anything but a simple exploratory analysis of the results; the idea to apply statistical methods to them was an afterthought and is intended only as an exercise. Overall, the sample and its many subsamples are too small to draw accurate conclusions on the entire _Tomb Raider_ fandom, as shown by the large margin of errors we've seen. Additionally, the social media outlets through which the survey was shared may over- or underrepresent different demographic groups, which has likely skewed the sample. All conclusions are tentative and would require a larger sample and/or more specific questions to be confirmed or rejected at a fandom level."
