Of these, 1304 were passengers and 861 were crew. The dataset is organised into columns as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `NAME`, `AGE`, and `SEX` are just standard demographic information. \n",
    "- `AGE_BRACKET` is a broader categorisation of each person's age: `0-9`, `10-19`, `20-29`, etc.\n",
    "- `AFFILIATION` is either `Crew` or `Passengers`, and it is used exclusively to be able to quickly separate the two sets of people.\n",
    "- `GROUP` applies to crew members only, and it identifies the eight broader groups to which a crew member could belong: Officers, Deck, Engineering, Victualling, Restaurant, Postal clerks, Guarantee group, and Orchestra. For passengers, this column has value `Not applicable`.\n",
    "- `POSITION` identifies the specific job of each crew member. For passengers, this column has value `Not applicable`.\n",
    "- `CLASS` can be `First`, `Second`, or `Third` in the case of passengers and of the Guarantee group crew members, who for some reason were given passenger accommodations. For other crew members, this column has value `Not applicable`.\n",

(As we'll see later on, 1462 is the number of actual victims in the dataset.) The overall randomised death and survival rates will be identical to the originals, but all other possible influencing factors will be eliminated. In other words, we'll know there are 1462 victims whose age, sex, affiliation, etc played no role in their fate. For the rest of the analysis, we'll refer to the ensemble of randomly chosen survivors and victims as the *shuffled Titanic*; the *shuffled crew*, the *shuffled passengers*, etc, will refer to randomly chosen survivors/victims among the crew, the passengers, etc. We'll often use the abbreviation \"SHF\" to refer to shuffled groups of people."

    "The chart above shows the absolute death rate instead of percentages, because given the significant difference between the sizes of the groups, percentages could be misleading. For example, 100% of waiters on the _Titanic_ died, but there were less than 20 of them in total and it surely wasn't a more dangerous job than that of engineers. With such a small number of waiters, random chance may well have been the most important factor that determined the fate of these unlucky people. By contrast, \"only\" about 72% of the Firemen/Stokers died, but as they were much more numerous, it's reasonable to conclude that so many of them died not because of chance, but because of their job's inherent risk in the event of the ship sinking. Indeed, they were part of the engineering team, who due to their physical location on the ship, as well as their desperate attempts to keep the systems of the ship going for as long as possible, had it arguably worse than anybody else onboard. (Incidentally, note that \"Stewardess\"—a job obviously done only by women—is at the bottom of the list, both in absolute and relative terms.)"

    "The chart leaves no doubt that class and death rates on the _Titanic_ were correlated: the lower the class, the higher the death rate, and obviously vice-versa for the survival rate. The reasons for this may be many, for example the location of cabins of different classes, possible discrimination operated by the crew, or the strings that higher-class passengers might have been able to pull to more easily secure a place on a lifeboat. However, once more this trend changes significantly when sex is accounted for."

    "The pattern \"high class, low death\" is not only preserved, but it is even more evident when looking at female passengers only: **death rates for female passengers decrease almost four-fold with each step from lower to higher class.** However, death rates among males are virtually identical (slightly above 80%) for second and third class passengers; first-class male passengers had it only slightly better, with a death rate of about 65%. A randomly chosen third-class female passenger of the _Titanic_ has a pretty much fair chance of being a survivor, about 15% higher than for a randomly chosen first-class male passenger. **A higher-class ticket always came with significantly better survival chances for female passengers; not so for males.** On the shuffled _Titanic_, class privilege is just not a thing; female and male passengers survive and die in very similar percentages across all classes.\n",

    "Survival rates are actually higher amongst the youngest and oldest, though their small number, especially for the latter cohort, is likely an important factor. It's not so strange, however that the youngest cohort had such a high survival rate, as their parents must surely have tried their hardest to ensure they wouldn't die. Survival rates are anyway fairly low amongst people between 60 and 79, for reasons that may include self-sacrifice or higher difficulty in escaping, but on which we can ultimately only speculate. Note, however, that just like in `Figure 8` we saw that the real survival rates by bracket were very close to shuffled ones for the whole ship, they're fairly close to each other for passengers only as well, again suggesting that the role of age might have been limited.\n",

    "Once again, **splitting the above histogram by sex reveals very different trends among males and females;** among male passengers, only children aged 0-9 and men aged 80-89 had exceptionally high survival rates; among female passengers, survival rates were always very high, 64% at a minimum. While these two distributions have a different number of age brackets of rather different sizes compared to the same distributions for the crew, the situation is again very similar: very low survival rates for (most) males, very high survival rates for all females. The situation is much more balanced on the shuffled _Titanic_ —which, let's not forget, has nonetheless the same overall death rate as the real _Titanic_."

A glance at the charts above is enough to tell that more adults died in absolute terms, but let's try to quantify this more precisely: let's define \"adult\" as anyone aged at least 18 and \"child\" anyone younger than 18. The table below shows the four categories sorted by their percentage of survivors. **Female adults have the highest percentage,** followed by female children and male children. Male adults come in last, with less than 21% of survivors. The `TOTAL` column shows the total count of people that were in each category."

    "We've analysed the survival rates for different groups of people aboard the _Titanic_, and compared some of them to those observed on the \"shuffled _Titanic_\"—that is, an imaginary ship that had the exact same overall death and survival rates, but whose victims and survivors were chosen entirely randomly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis leaves little doubt that **women and children did indeed come first:** no matter how you look at it, women had much lower death rates than males, irrespective of affiliation, age, or class. The number of women on the _Titanic_ was very small compared to that of men, and thus it might be that at least in the case of some particularly small subset of women, random chance might have determined their high survival rates. This, however, happened systematically for each and every group of women considered, while it hardly ever happened for any group of men, no matter how small. Additionally, on the shuffled _Titanic_, women and men died in very similar percentages, and no bias in favour of female (or male) survival was observed, irrespective of group size. (It should be noted that, on the shuffled _Titanic_, any possible influencing factor was eliminated, not just sex.) We also saw that, on the real _Titanic_, female adults had the highest survival rates, followed by female children, male children, and finally adult males.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the above, it's very unlikely that the imbalance in survival rates observed on the _Titanic_ was due to mere chance; \"women and children first\" was definitely at play, whether intentionally or by unconscious bias. Naturally, it is also possible that some other factor might have been at play—women might have a stronger survival instinct, for example, or be more resilient to the conditions everyone was exposed to during the tragedy—but this is mere speculation and not something we can infer from the data."
