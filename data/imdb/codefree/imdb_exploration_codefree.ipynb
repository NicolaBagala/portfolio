    "\n",
    "- `ID` is a unique alphanumeric string automatically assigned by IMDB to each movie.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `TITLE` is the original title of a movie.\n",
    "- `RELEASE_YEAR` is the year when a movie was [first released](https://help.imdb.com/article/contribution/titles/release-dates/GVUUDEPJNAW6G35P#) to the public.\n",
    "- `GENRE` is a string specifying the genres that apply to a movie.\n",
    "- `LENGTH_MIN` is the length of a movie, in minutes.\n",
    "- `COUNTRY` is a string specifying the origin country (or countries) of a movie.\n",
    "- `BUDGET_USD` and `GLOBAL_GROSS_USD` are the budget and worldwide gross of a movie, expressed in inflation-adjusted 2021 United State Dollars.\n",
    "- `WAVG_SCORE` is a weighted average of the scores that IMDB users have given to the movie. This value is calculated by IMDB according to a formula that [they chose not to disclose](https://help.imdb.com/article/imdb/track-movies-tv/weighted-average-ratings/GWT2DSBYVT2F25SK?ref_=helpsect_pro_2_8#). In the text, I sometimes refer to this score as the 'IMDB score'.\n",
    "- `VOTES` is the number of votes that a movie has received from IMDB users. (Users can vote only once for each given movie, so `VOTES` is equivalent to the number of IMDB users who cast a vote on a given movie.)\n",
    "- `M_AVG_SCORE` and `F_AVG_SCORE` contain the average score given to each movie by male and female IMDB users, respectively.\n",
    "- `M_017_AVG_SCORE` to `M_45PLUS_AVG_SCORE` break down a movie's average score by age brackets for male voters (`45PLUS` means age 45 and above). For example, if `M_017_AVG_SCORE` was 7.3 for *The Prestige*, it would mean that the average score that IMDB male users between the ages of 0 and 17 gave to that movie is 7.3. Similarly, columns `F_017_AVG_SCORE` to `F_45PLUS_AVG_SCORE` refer to female users only."

Around the time of the spikes, there are only about 8 known revenues per year; that is very little, so, let's say instead that we want at least 25 known revenues in a year to bother calculating the average revenue for that year, and let's plot that subset of the data.\n",

The maximum revenue, represented by the end of each top whisker, is very similar across the three time frames, and the three average revenues—in blue—aren't that far apart from each other either. However, the three median revenues (in red) all have different orders of magnitude: the 1945-1975 median is around \\\\$460.000; the 1976-2000 median is about \\\\$11 million, and the 2001-2020 median is around \\\\$1 million.

    "The above is a broad overview that doesn't take into account voter age. It would be interesting to see if this phenomenon changes in any way when age cohorts are considered. Doing so across all movie genres is beyond the scope of this project, but to conclude this exploration, we can calculate how the average male and female scores change overall with age.\n",

    "According to the chart above, **the average score given by a cohort of people of either sex to any movie, regardless of its genre or anything else, decreses as the cohort's age increases.** For example, we see that, on average, female IMDB voters between the ages of 18 and 29 rate movies just above 6.3; the same rating drops to less than 6.1 for female voters aged 30 to 44, and it drops even further for the next cohort.\n",

    "This chart too suggests that females are slightly more generous when scoring movies than males are, and on top of that, males become more critical than females do with age. For some reason, the females younger than 17 appear a bit more critical than males of the same age range, but the difference is minimal and doesn't negate the overall trends observed."

    "During this quick exploration of a dataset of nearly 90000 movies, we tried to answer a few questions about movie budgets, revenues, length, and scores. We found out that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- on average, **budgets have slowly but fairly steadily grown** from the early 1900s to 2020;\n",
    "\n",
    "- if a few outliers from the 1940s are excluded, on average **revenues grew slowly from the early 1900s to about 1980,** when they began to slowly taper off. However, when looking at the median revenue, we saw that it was a fairly flat line throughout the entire century, barring the aforementioned outliers and **a prominent peak around the 1980s that took about 20 years to disappear**. We saw that, indeed, movies from the 1976-2000 time frame often grossed much more than movies in 1945-1975 and 2001-2020;\n",
    "\n",
    "- on average, **movies with higher budgets gross more**, which seems to be especially true in the case of very large budgets;\n",
    "\n",
    "- **the average movie has become longer and longer over the past century**, from about 55 minutes in 1900 to over an hour and half in 2020. **Longer movies are more expensive on average**, with the average budget growing up to almost 100 million USD for movies in the 3 to 4 hours range. Movies longer than four hours are rather rare, but their budget is closer to 20 million USD on average;\n",
    "\n",
    "- **IMDB users rate older movies more highly than newer ones on average**. Movies from the 1930s score around 6.8 on average, but from there, the average rating plummets all the way down to 5.6 for movies from 2020;\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Higher budgets show a very weak correlation with higher scores.** In particular, between 10 and 100 million USD, budgets don't seem to make much of a difference in terms of score, which gravitates around 6.3. With higher budgets, the average score reaches up to 7 points;\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The revenue range for movies scoring up to 7 points is on average fairly narrow,** up to 50.000.000 USD. From that point on, there's a rather steep growth that takes the average revenue all the way up to over 300 million USD for movies scoring around 9. We shouldn't forget, however, that the presence of few high-scoring, very high-grossing outliers skews this average upward;\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Very few western countries are among the top-10 in terms of movie scores.** Somewhat surprisingly, Soviet Union movies have an average score of about 7.1 and are at the top of the list, while the United States are almost at the very bottom of the list of all countries, with a meagre average score of 5.6. It might be that, in the cases of some countries, the location of the voters influences the scores in a way or another (for example, if most voters of a certain movie all come from the same country that produced the movie), but this is not something we could verify because this kind of information was simply not available in the dataset;\n",
    "\n",
    "- **On average, female voters score _every_ movie genre higher than male voters.** The difference is small but present for all genres, which suggests that male voters might be more \"picky,\" and that they grow more so with age. On average, a movie scored by young males up to 17 years old scores 6.2, against 5.6 in the case of males aged 45 and older. Female voters too become \"pickier\" with age, but much less so: across all age cohorts, the difference between the maximum and minimum average score from female voters is about a mere 0.3."
