# Welcome to my programming portfolio!

<p align="justify">This repository is a collection of my various programming projects, categorised by language and/or topic. Below is a short list of all the subrepos.</p>

<ul>
    <li><b><a href="https://github.com/NicolaBagala/portfolio/tree/master/data">Data:</a></b> Data analysis/science projects. Mostly Python and SQL for now.</li>
    <li><b><a href="https://github.com/NicolaBagala/portfolio/tree/master/visual_basic">Visual Basic:</a></b> Projects I built in Visual Basic, one of my earliest languages. Many were lost, but I'll probably make new ones in the future.</li>
<ul>
